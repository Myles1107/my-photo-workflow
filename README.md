# my-photo-workflow
Description of my usual workflow for storing, organizing and backing up my personal photo/video collection.

## Vision
To build the perfect personal memories album, by taking advantage of the digital tools we have today.
To achieve this goal, the collection must be:

0. **Personal**: Aggregating everything that's **relevant** to me - not only photos I take but also photos people taken of me, photos of moments I was in, photos from ancestors and photos from dear people - everything that's part of my history.
1. **Complete**: Containing **every picture or video** I can put my hands on, from the past (by scanning old photos or scavenging old hard drives) to the future (by defining a process in which I can make sure any content produced from now on will be part of the collection).
2. **Chronological**: Making sure that every item in the collection is in its correct place in history, **date and time**.
3. **Contextual**: Being organized by **recognizable moments** and providing means of **searching** for people, places, events, things, details.
4. **Presentable**: Avoiding the tedious 'directories-and-files' approach by allowing for a navigation that focus on the media itself - a **scrollable timeline of moments**.
5. **Shareable**: Giving means for **easily sharing** the moments that may be relevant to others - as well as **avoiding the exposure of the things that are private**.

## My media sources
- Photos and videos taken with iPhone 6S (usual setup: HDR on; LivePhotos on; Videos 1080p @ 60fps)
- Videos taken with the GoPro HERO 3 Black (various settings)
- Scans of old photos
- Photos and videos found around old hard drives, the internet, etc

## The core process
1. **Cloud Repository/Backup**: Photos are uploaded automatically to some cloud storage so the phone is not the single point of failure anymore.
2. **Staging**: Some app is used to import the photos and split then into events. At this point any needed fix is done (specially timestamp ones).
3. **Archiving**: The event is saved to a definitive location in the cloud storage (and whatever other backup mechanism)

## Choice of software
 1. **Cloud Repository/Backup**: Dropbox Camera Upload
 2. **Staging**: iPhoto 9.6.4 (plus some scripts found in this repository)
 3. **Archiving**: Dropbox  (premim account with 1TB storage)

### TODO

- Detail the workflow
- Upload the ruby scripts
- Point the drawbacks (not really contextual yet, etc)
- Revisit history of this process (Photo Stream, etc)
